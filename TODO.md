- [x] job progress bar on the jobs page not working (works in info page). Should use the same component
- [x] when metadata is not yet calculated for a post, it sets width height to 0 (I think), so on post details page the image is invisible because its dimensions are set to 0x0
- [x] check if ffmpeg stuff cannot be sped up, e.g. dHash calculation and metadata extraction is slow despite the CPU nor HDD seems to be heavily utilized
- [x] add endpoint for posts around some query (similar to bakabooru), so that I can go to next/previous post in post details with the given filter
- [x] implement tag and tag category management (view, add, delete, assign, rename, merge, etc)
- check if polling jobs API is better than having a websocket connection
- [x] remove jobs from the info page
- [x] remove scan libraries button from info page
- [x] libraries page is bad
- [x] library should have a name
- [x] per library info should be displayed
- [x] individual libraries should be scannable
- [x] implement simple auth (no roles, just putting everything behind a login)
- [x] posts order should be by the real file creation/modified date
- ability to add paths to ignore list (e.g. subfolder of a library)
- add post sources table, APIs, and integrate in UI
- add the abilitiy to favorite posts
- remove old compabitility with oxibooru.. just use bakabooru apis. Remove stuff not needed for bakabooru like registration, upload etc
- [x] add more search options, e.g. by type (image, video), by tag count, favorite, etc
- add help page with keyboard shortcuts, search syntax, etc
- dockerize everything (should be able to map db and thumbnail paths). Have github action to publish client and server images to ghcr
- [x] write a script that will migrate tags from bakabooru to bakabooru (go through posts, reverse search, get tags). Will have to decode jxl to jpg first cuz bakabooru doesnt support jxl
- re-consider how to handle auto-tagging (e.g. should it move to server-side, whether to implement hash-based reverse lookup for gelbooru and danbooru, deepdanbooru, ...)
